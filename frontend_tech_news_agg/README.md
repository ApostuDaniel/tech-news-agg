# frontend_tech_news_agg

TechNewsAgg â€“ Create an app that aggregates tech news from different sites and
displays them all in one unified news feed. The app should have a list of possible news
sites to which the user can subscribe as well as support for multiple users (locally). Each
user will be displayed only news from his subscription list. These preferences should be
stored using SharedPreferences.
